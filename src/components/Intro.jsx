        <p>
          I grew up in Pamidi, a small village in Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh,
          surrounded by the pleasant sounds of good music in our home. My life
          has been shaped by the strong bonds of family and the influence of
          music. For my college education, I attended Sree Vidyanikethan
          Engineering College, where I earned a Bachelor of Technology degree in
          Computer Science and System Engineering.
